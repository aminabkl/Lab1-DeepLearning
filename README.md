In this repository, you'll find the implementation of a deep learning project focused on predicting stock prices. The project leverages PyTorch to construct a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model and incorporates GridSearchCV for optimizing hyperparameters. The provided code comprises modules for:

1. Loading and preprocessing data (the dataset that was used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse)
2. Constructing and training the model
3. Tuning hyperparameters
4. Evaluating and visualizing results

Throughout the course of this project, I have acquired valuable insights and skills, such as:

- Proficiency in PyTorch: Working extensively with PyTorch has deepened my comprehension of neural network architectures and enhanced my ability to implement them effectively. Whether defining layers or optimizing models, PyTorch's flexibility and user-friendly interface have been instrumental in achieving project goals.
