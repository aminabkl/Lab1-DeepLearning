## PART ONE : Regression

In the first part, you'll find the implementation of a deep learning project focused on predicting stock prices. The project leverages PyTorch to construct a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model and incorporates GridSearchCV for optimizing hyperparameters. The provided code comprises modules for:

1. Loading and preprocessing data (the dataset that was used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse)
2. Constructing and training the model
3. Tuning hyperparameters
4. Evaluating and visualizing results

## PART TWO : Multi Class Classification:

In the second part, we tackled a comprehensive deep learning task involving a dataset containing information on a manufacturing process. The project covered several key aspects of deep learning and neural network development. Initially, we conducted thorough data preprocessing, including cleaning and standardization/normalization. Subsequently, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, employing techniques such as statistical summaries, correlation analysis, and visualization.

To address class imbalance, data augmentation techniques were applied to ensure a more balanced representation of classes. The core of the project involved establishing a deep neural network architecture using PyTorch for multi-class classification. Hyperparameter tuning was facilitated through GridSearchCV from scikit-learn, enabling the identification of optimal settings for parameters like learning rate, optimizers, and model architecture.

Visualizations of loss and accuracy over epochs were created to analyze the model's training and testing performance. The project also included the calculation of essential metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score, for both training and test datasets. Finally, regularization techniques, specifically L1 and L2 regularization, were introduced to the neural network architecture, and the subsequent results were compared with the initial model. This comprehensive approach allowed for a holistic understanding of the dataset, effective model development, and rigorous evaluation techniques.
